# MiST - Video Game Digital Distribution Platform
Welcome to the MiST platform website! MiST is a PC video game digital distribution platform, where publishers and developers put up their PC games and DLCs on sale digitally for everyone WORLDWIDE! You can register an account with us and purchase games on the MiST platform, where it will belong to you forever!

## Context
MiST is a game project done during my education with Trent Global College. In my third and final project, I will be demonstrating the usage of ReactJS, Adonis.js and MySQL to develop a platform where users can be simulated to buy games.

My goal is to create a simplistic and attractive single page application website using the knowledge of what I have learnt over the course of the bootcamp. I want to ensure that users will enjoy their time on the platform, and at the same time be as close to a real platform as possible.

# Demo
The demo of the site will be available soon...

# Notes
This repository only contains the front end codes for Project MiST. Backend codes can be found [here](https://github.com/yuhengen/proj3-mist-adonis)

# UI/UX
## Identifying the Users (STRATEGY)
The primary purpose of MiST is to have users create accounts and purchase video games on our platform. Our potential targets are gamers in general, as there will be a wide array of games and genre available on MiST.

### Owner Stories
```
- As the owner and developer of MiST, I want to get as many publishers and developers to put their games up on sale on MiST, so that it can attract more users to use our platform to purchase games
- As the owner and developer of MiST, I want as many users as possible on our platform purchasing games, so that we are able to profit from the commissions
- As the owner of MiST, I want to create a user-friendly platform for users to purchase and own games, so that will come back to use MiST
```

### User Stories (Developers/Publishers)
```
- As a developer/publisher of games, I want a platform where my games can reach as many users as possible, so that we are able to gain sales and reputation out of it
- As a developer/publisher of games, I want a user-friendly site/platform, so that I can easily manage my published products
- As a developer/publisher of games, I want information such as my sales numbers to be easily accessed, so that I am able keep track of my sales and targets
```

### User Stories (Gamers/Users)
```
- As a user, I want a platform where I can purchase, store and download my favorite games, so that I don't have to continuously switch between platforms when playing different games
- As a user, I want a platform where I can view my past transactions, so that I am able to keep track of my expenses
- As a user, I want a user-friendly platform, so that I am able to access the information I want to in a couple of clicks
